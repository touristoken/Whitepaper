ABSTRACT

Tourism plays an important role in most people's lives , It is a source of entertainment, culture and
discovery at some, and an economic source that includes a large part of the sources of income,
many countries are racing to highlight their tourist attractions to attract many tourists around the
world , Since the start of the online booking, there have been developments in the rates of tourism
growth in the countries, online Advertiser Companies Race In Offering Services And Offers For
Tourists , however a large number of Internet tourist bookings have declined for many reasons,
Such as, account piracy, non-receipt of offers, personal data entry, After the launch of the
technology and development of the Blockchain , There have been many solutions to these reasons,
which have led to a decrease in the rate of tourist bookings, One of the most important
developments of the Blockchain is the ethereum network with all its tools which We used to
launch this project, It was a combination of the usual styles in tourist booking, and the innovative
idea offered by touristoken to the tourist booking platforms, To become the first of its kind in a
combination of tourist booking and the technology of the Blockchain , Let's see what's new and
how this project has Repair many of the problems of online booking.

INTRODUCTION

 Background
 
We are a team of partners in tourism companies and private transport companies in four countries.
We work in the field of online booking, with direct partners from airports, hotels and car rental
companies, and third party partners we promote them for commissions, and the idea of the project
is to combine the booking of internet tourism with the normal methods with the technique of
Blockchain, how is it done? We have set up a platform at the company's official website, allowing
customers to book reservations and get discounts from partners, this is done in two ways that will
be noted in detail, the first method is: TOU-B (book & win) reward customers by TOU token
when making reservations with our direct partners and third party partners, They are given to them
immediately after confirming the booking with the partner. The second method is: TOU-D
(Discount coupons) Giving the customer a special discount by sharing the profit ratio between the
company and the customers. This discount is sold by TOU token at a rate of 30% to 50% of the
discount value. So to encourage booking from the platform, without requiring any personal or
credit data, just confirm the reservation to receive the reward.
We have launched a smart contract with Ethereum to enable the platform to send and receive
token in an easy, fast and secure, using a gateway system between a fixed wallet of the site and
Metamask customer wallets, Team members from developers have created this included the
contract code, Such as in the Decentralized platforms and sites that do not use data in the login,
Just use the signature of the wallet with the site. The difficulty of receiving rewards has been
solved without the need to enter credit or personal information; we are now working to enable the
customer to complete the reservation using the token via the platform or mobile application.

Vision

Token was created based on the techniques available through the ethereum network, which is
based on the original Blockchain, To be an innovative way to reward customers to encourage
online booking, , The first TOKEN code on the ethereum network used for international tourism
reservation services, and the Matamask (Web3) token site will be connected to the security and
speed of purchase and payment, you will not need the old registration method, all members of
their booking data are registered in Database directly linked to Blockchain, using the signature
property, the website has its own portfolio such as platforms, to protect the customer in the
purchase of services, with an unlimited proportion of the total supply of the brand, more than no
less, an automatic gateway was created to buy and sell currency directly Without the need for 
manual transportation, according to the map We plan to create a special mobile wallet, which
facilitates the use of symbolic transfer, payment, delivery and receipt as soon as possible, the
currency price will be fixed against the dollar price, the price is adjusted compared to the ethereum
price, giving investors and others safety in the light of price fluctuations, The team has long
experience in tourism, and this makes the market exist, not the moment, especially with new
technology, we will not create ICO because the desire is to use TOU in the services of the site and
not in trading platforms or storage, because the price will be as fixed as possible.

TOU-B

In the usual way, we direct you to the partner's sites to make a reservation. When booking, you get
your reservation number, all you have to do is submit the reservation number, and Ethereum
wallet address, supports ERC-20 token, inside each offer shows the number of Token you receive,
you can use them to buy discount codes tou-d, or sell them on our exchange or available platforms
and recover value, This will be done manually until the customer accounts are completed and
linked to Matamask without the need for any personal or credit data.

TOU-D

This is an important point in the project; we will explain to you a goal before explaining how to
use it.
There are basic booking methods connecting the tourist and advertiser, and ways to connect the
booking platform with the advertiser.
The new method is TOU-D, There are pros and cons in the usual ways, and all the negatives were
solved and added a lot of pros.

1 - Tourist & advertiser

C=Customer

1=Direct booking

2=Third party booking

3=TOU-D

- C 1 reward = A & B

A= Nothing, unless the place advertised for the offers only, is not always available

B= they need credit data or cash payment.

- C  2 reward = D & E & F

D= Points or gifts received after confirmation of the booking and payment, and this depends on
the credibility of this party

E= A real discount is calculated on the total paid but added to the fees and taxes

F= need credit and personal information at two parties

- C3 reward = T

T= Confirmed, directly, A known and declared discount on the total paid without adding taxes or
fees, without credit or personal information, Received after confirmation of booking and do not
need to wait, When you launch a mobile application you can also book and pay for it.

2- Platform & advertiser


1= Platform

2= advertiser

A= Direct Customer to advertiser

B= reservation confirmation

C= Waiting for payment dates or minimum payment, Review the verified bookings and give a
report.

D= Recent review and payment

E= Receipt of dues in bank account or agreed source, Discount taxes and fees, Exchange of the
customer's reward (3).

With TOU-D:

1- You agree with the advertiser on a discount rate on the total paid at the confirmation of booking

2- Receipt of the commission of the advertisement on the platform, after the customer accepts the
conditions and pay for the purchase of the coupon, do not forget: The customer is sharing with you
in your commission to make this booking.

3- Now you have token for the service, you can sell them to recover your commission, or use it to
reward more customers when booking, in case of dealing with advertisers who do not use this
method.

4- Now you receive your commissions without waiting, delay, mistake or bank fees, and the
advertiser does not commit to pay or transfer any transactions, only commitment to give the
customer discount as agreed.

5- You can register all transactions in your signature on the Blockchain.

As we have already explained, we have direct partners and third party partners, it was agreed with
the partners to implement the idea of discounts instead of commissions, and many partners are
added with a time plan, to spread our services around the world.
Other services are being prepared, Such as booking trains, ships, Vacations, restaurants, etc., They
are announced when the preparation is complete.

MECHANISM

Blockchain Overview

Just about everything we do, involves the creation and movement of data to it hotels bills, home
rent, using public transport or the credit card trail. The Blockchain is a new way of storing and
moving that data, wherein instead of holding that data in one place the information is spread over
thousands of nodes across a network, all locked together with the help of cryptography. In this
way, by replacing centralized authority with decentralized computing, Blockchain allows us a new
way of transacting with one another by bypassing traditional centralized entities like the bank,
currently at the heart of almost all human transactions. The Blockchain gives us a database that is
decentralized or a digital ledger of transactions anyone on the network can see using cryptography
to keep exports secure. Now, before an exchange can be verified and recorded, this network,
basically a string of computers, should all give its approval.

Ethereum (metamask)

Metamask is a bridge that allows you to visit the distributed network tomorrow in your browser
today. This program allows you to run the Ethereum dApps application in your browser
without having to run a full Ethereum node, Metamask includes a secure identity vault,
providing a user interface to manage your identities on different sites and sign Blockchain
transactions, You can install the Metamask add-on in Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and the new
Brave browser, it is mission is to make Ethereum as easy to use for as many people as possible.

Smart contract

Smart contracts are applications that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This is a Decentralized
"world computer" where the computing power is provided by all those Ethereum nodes. Any
nodes providing computing power are paid for that resource in Ether tokens. They're named smartcontracts
because you can write "contracts" that are automatically executed when the requirements
are met.

Touristoken platform

Is a decentralized platform created by Smart contract with the ethereum network, This platform
allows its users to book tourist reservations for airports, hotels and other services, Searching for
the best deals in the world, Use discount coupons and loyalty programs, And receive rewards for
their booking.
The platform is based on the theory of decentralization, as they are not linked to personal accounts
or credit information, it is used by creating a temporary account for the customer with the
Metamask wallet, and the customer gives permission to connect his wallet to the site by:
One-Click Login Flow, new login method: A one-click, cryptographically-secure login flow using
the Metamask extension, with all data stored on our own back end. 

Metamask is a browser plugin, available as the Metamask Chrome extension or Firefox Add-on.
At its core, it serves as an Ethereum wallet: By installing it, you will get access to a unique
Ethereum public address, with which you can start sending and receiving ether or tokens.
But Metamask does something more than an Ethereum wallet. As a browser extension, it can
interact with the current webpage you’re browsing. It does so by injecting a JavaScript library
called web3.js in every webpage you visit. Once injected, a web3 object will be available
via window.web3 in the JavaScript code of this website. To have a look at what this object looks
like, just type window.web3 in the Chrome or Firefox DevTools console, if you have MetaMask
installed, Web3.js is a JavaScript interface to the Ethereum Blockchain. There are functions to:

Get the latest block of the chain (web3.eth.getBlockNumber)

Check the current active account on Metamask (web3.eth.coinbase)

Get the balance of any account (web3.eth.getBalance)

Send transactions (web3.eth.sendTransaction)

Sign messages with the private key of the current account (web3.personal.sign)


The basic idea is that it’s cryptographically easy to prove the ownership of an account by signing a
piece of data using a private key. If you manage to sign a precise piece of data generated by our
back end, then the back end will consider you the owner of that public address. Therefore, we can
build a message-signing-based authentication mechanism with a user’s public address as their
identifier, Most functions in web3.js are read functions (get block, get balance, etc.),
and web3 will give the response immediately. However, some functions
(like web3.eth.sendTransaction and web3.personal.sign) need the current account to sign some
data with its private key. These functions trigger MetaMask to show a confirmation screen, to
double-check that the user knows what she or he is signing.
Let’s see how to use MetaMask for this. To make a simple test, paste the following line in the
DevTools console:
web3.personal.sign (web3.fromUtf8 ("Hello from Tou!"), web3.eth.coinbase, console.log);
This command means: Sign my message, converted from utf8 to hex, with the coinbase account
(i.e. current account), and as a callback, print the signature. A MetaMask popup will appear, and if
you sign it, the signed message will be printed; we use web3.personal.sign in our login flow.
You have now created an account connected to the Metamask wallet, you can use it directly to
exchange the token or deposit from your wallet into web wallet to buy a discount coupon using it
or Withdraw from web wallet to your wallet or Transfer from your account to another account.

Web wallet

touristoken.eth

The Ethereum Name Service is a distributed, open, and extensible
naming system based on the Ethereum Blockchain. Once you have a name, you can tell your
friends to send ETH to touristoken.eth instead of 0xf8b9bba98ed7fce01d....., 12% of the Total
Supply has been allocated to this wallet, Linked to the master account of the site, for exchanges,
deposit and withdrawal, using the gateway built into the contract code.
The platform does not need to enter any credit or personal data; it does not have a database for
members, they are used in two ways TOU-B & TOU-D.
